# Hot Dog Survey Data

This is the first project investigating whether UVA undergraduate students believe a hotodog is a sandwich or not. Our hypothesis is that 1/2 of UVA full-time undergraduate students believe a hot dog is a sandwich. Our data is uploaded as a csv file, and our data dictionary is in the file data_dict_sp25.
